Extract trajectory module
===========================

The output data of Mixing-REMD sampling is collected from each processor. When the exchange happens, the temperature
at each processor is swapped. If one want to analyze the trajectory in each temperature, then the trajectory file and information file of Mixing-REMD should be extracted and distribute among each temperature.

The extract module need a input file named "extracted.in" which has a "trajs" namelist


`trajs` namelist
-------------------

:num_file: **integer** number of file of total trajectory or information file
:procFile: **array of characers** The name of each "procinfo" file
:ncv: **integer** number of collective variables in the "procinfo" file
:trajFile: **array of characers** When this variables is specified, then the NETCDF format of Cartesian coordinate files are extracted among each temperature.
:removeFirstFrame: **logical** Save the first frame or not (Default: not remove the first frame)

Example
------------
The example of input file shows below ::

    &trajs
        num_file = 4
        procFile = "procinfo_0.txt", "procinfo_1.txt",
                "procinfo_2.txt", "procinfo_3.txt"
        ncv = 2
        trajFile = "traj_0.mdcrd", "traj_1.mdcrd",
                "traj_2.mdcrd", "traj_3.mdcrd"
    /

Output File Format
-------------------
The output process file name is "levelinfo_0.txt" which has same format of "procinfo_0.txt"
The output trajectory file name is "level_0.nc" which has same format of "traj_0.mdcrd"


Run the extract command
-----------------------

1. The input file name must be "extract.in"
2. When the `trajFile` is not provided, then only procFile is extracted.
